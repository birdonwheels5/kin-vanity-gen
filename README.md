Vanity address generator for KIN. Currently for Stellar (KIN3) addresses. I will try to update this for Solana once we get closer to the migration.

Tested and developed on Google Chrome. No guarantee this will work on Internet Explorer.

If you like this and it has helped you generate some cool addresses, please consider donating some KIN as a thank you:
